Coursera Robotics Specialization 
The capstone project was divided into six weeks. I will summarize what I did week by week.
Week 1: I learned how to use MATLAB to solve ODEs.For practice, we modeled the Duffing equation, which is a second-order non-linear differential equation that is used to model slightly complex damped oscillations. Ones that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Here is the plot.
